The following labs will give you hands-on experience with a number of the topics discussed during the AWS Innovate AI/ML Edition 2022.

ℹ️ **You will run these lab in your own AWS account. Please follow directions at the end of the labs to remove resources to minimize costs.**

These labs will remain available after AWS Innovate AI/ML Edition. **You can do them at any time**, even after AWS Innovate AI/ML Edition 2022.

## [Creating a multi-label classification model on SageMaker using BlazingText Algorithm](https://github.com/roshansthomas/sm-sentimentanalysis-bt)
The Amazon SageMaker BlazingText algorithm provides highly optimized implementations of the Word2vec and text classification algorithms. In this lab you will use the Amazon BlazingText algorithm with SageMaker to create a supervised multi-label text classification machine learning model.

Duration: Approximately 60 minutes

## [Build, train, and debug machine learning models](https://github.com/roshansthomas/reinvent2019-aim362-sagemaker-debugger-model-monitor)

In this lab, we show the different aspects of the machine learning (ML) workflow for building, training, and deploying a model using all the capabilities of Amazon SageMaker. We also discuss how Amazon SageMaker removes the heavy lifting from each step of the ML workflow. Come learn how to build, train, debug, monitor, and deploy your ML models. 

Duration: Approximately 90 minutes
